    "text": "There are five reasons why you might want to give a hotel a  5 star review:\n1. Ambiance: The hotel is perfectly situated opposite Hyde Park and as soon as you walk in there is a wonderful atmosphere of a well run and comfortable hotel with everything you could possibly want or need catered for.\n2. Staff: Everyone from the concierge, to reception to the waitresses serving at table seem really to enjoy being helpful and to deal with any queries you might have, it is service with a smile.\n3. Food: This time we only had breakfast but as far as I go it has to be the best breakfast in town.\n4.  The Room:  Ours was on the 14th floor and the panoramic view of London was simply breathtaking, day and night, the kingsized bed was simply luxurious, fit for a king!\n5. The Management: A well run and happy hotel is always down to the Management and here the hotel clearly excels.\n\nAnd so it is an easily earned  five stars from me!",

    "text": "The Royal Lancaster is an elegant and refined hotel.  Its location across the street from Hyde Park is lovely and its staff is outstanding.  The bedrooms are little small by American standards but typical and perhaps larger than most European rooms.  The rooms have a good refrigerator, a heated towel rack, plenty of shelf space in the bathrooms, and a comfortable sofa.  The beds and pillows were very good.\n\nThe hotel really shines in its staff.  There is a huge number of them (the staff to guest ratio must be amazingly good) and they are unfailingly professional, polite, and competent.  The concierges are world class.  Special thanks to Sebastian and Matt.  They are so outstanding they probably have their choice of hotels at which to work.  The front desk staff was excellent and professional.\n\nBreakfast was top-notch.  My wife thought it our best ever, and it is certainly in my top three.  Great selection, beautifully prepared, top-quality ingredients, and delicious.  The breakfast staff, of which there must be a hundred, were gracious, friendly, and very helpful.  Special thanks to Viktoria, Yolanda, Ediri, Ayksa, Carolain, and Hannah for taking care of us so well.\n\nHyde Park is immediately accessible from the hotel and is beautiful and completely safe.  We walked there numerous times.\n\nThe hotel is not perfect.  The major problem is outside traffic noise.  There are motorcycles day and night on Bayswater Rd., Westbourne Terrace, and Lancaster Terrace.  We were on the 14th floor facing west, but I don't think one can escape the noise despite the double-glazed windows.  Medium and deep sleepers should have no trouble, but light sleepers may suffer.  Of course, traffic noise in a city is to be expected and most hotels in the city probably have it.  One does become somewhat accustomed to it eventually.\n\nTaxis are always available in front of the hotel and the porters and bellmen are excellent.\n\nOne cannot go wrong with this hotel.  It’s outstanding and is a great value for a top hotel in London.",

What a stunningly beautiful, bountiful breakfast… name it and they had it… even a slab of honey comb to cut your honey from… and a pitcher of chocolate sauce for the French toast( which children were enjoying no end!).\nAs I left, the woman at the desk gave me a box of hand made chocolates for my journey.

    "text": "Family suite perfection!  This was my second stay but first with the family for vacation.  We booked a family classic suite which is two adjoining rooms for a family of four.   The rooms are smaller but expertly designed with storage and layout for all your needs.  Bathrooms are a not small at all.  The property location is excellent for family vacations with immediate proximity to the tube but also in a slightly more quiet neighborhood for more relaxation and strolls to local restaurants.  Critically, it is extremely convenient walk to Paddington for the Heathrow Express.\n\nThe staff are tremendous with special recognition to the breakfast staff, housekeeping, and front desk.  They treat everyone as a luxury hotel but in a relaxed and non-snobby manner.  \n\nThe rooms are immaculately cleaned  - SPOTLESS!  The beds are a bit firm which is my personal preference.\n\nThe breakfast buffet is extremely comprehensive, efficient, delicious, and included in rate for members.  \n\nDuring check-in, we requested one of the beds be converted to two twin beds (for our children’s room).  Which they offered to immediately resolve by sending housekeeping to make the switch.  We were not in the rooms five minutes when staff turned up to change the bed layout and then they left silently five minutes later.  Very impressive!\n\nAnother guest above us caused some flooding in the bathroom.  We were quickly sorted out by being moved to another family suite of same caliber within 30 minutes.  It was a quite an ordeal for the staff but all handled with grace and minimal disruption to us.  \n\nThe property is very family friendly (as witnessed at breakfast with a decent number of children) but also hosted multiple evening black tie galas on first floor. \n\nOverall, this is a luxury caliber hotel with excellent value for the price charged.",

    "text": "We stayed for a week at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London.  Where do we begin with our feedback other than to say what an amazing team of people.\n\nOur first impression was Maggie (Front Office Manager).  We called in advance to advise that we were coming to London for medical reasons and needed to be assured to have a quiet and comfortable room.  Maggie walked us through the various room choices and then made recommendations, she even went through to the trouble of helping us to get a visual of where our room would be located. We also had various other requests to be in place prior to arrival – all of which Maggie was more than happy to accommodate.  In our past experiences with other hotels across the globe, other managers have committed to fulfilling certain requests only for us to be disappointed when we arrive at the hotel.  This is definitely NOT the case with Maggie. Everything she organized far exceeded our expectations and we were happy from the moment we arrived. \n\nThe rooms are tastefully decorated, have panaromic views, very comfortable beds and all the ammenties anyone would need.\n\nBeing mindful of our medical needs, in spite of how busy Maggie obviously is, she checked on us several times throughout out stay and to say she went above and beyond is an understatement.  There really aren’t words to describe how grateful we were to have connected with Maggie – she is a SUPERSTAR.  Thank you SO MUCH Maggie!\n\nWe were invited to the ‘spooky’ Halloween tea in the Lobby Hotel café.  What a treat!  Everything had been made fresh in the hotel and the design of the cakes was creative and festive and the ‘spooky surprise’ was very clever – our compliments to the chef.  We were served by Daniella and her service and attention to detail was impressive and the passion she obviously has in her work shone through.  Hannah greeted us and we also met Viktoria, who along with Daniella, ensured that our experience was top notch.  And of course, Maggie came to check on us which was a delightful surprise.  Maggie is everywhere and clearly an integral part of why this hotel operates so smoothly and delivers far beyond other London hotels that we have stayed at.  She is truly fabulous and the most professional, warm hotel managers that we have met. \n\nBreakfast each day was amazing.  You could not ask for a better spread and choice of items – you would surely want for nothing.  There were plenty of wait staff around, and all were very attentive. Carolain and Viktoria were there every day to greet and seat us and ensure that our every need was met.  We observed each morning that that Viktoria in particular treated all of the guests with her warm, helpful manner.  Hannah also greeted us many times asking if we were enjoying our stay.  We were told on our first day that breakfast tables could not be reserved and were assigned on a first come first serve basis, which we understood,  However on our last morning, when I asked to be seated at a vacant window table, I was informed that it was reserved for a ‘special guest’ and we observed that there was at least one more table with a reserved sign that morning. Kelvin eventually moved us to the window table, which was appreciated. I am mentioning this purely because if the hotel’s policy is a first come first serve basis, they should adhere to that policy for everyone.  \n\nWe also met Jamie – bellman/concierge - in the lift and in the Lobby.  Although he was very busy, he was friendly, very welcoming and easy to chat with.\nNo doubt there are other members of the team that are not named in this review; however it is obvious that their hard work contributes to the smooth running of this hotel. \n\nDuring a very different, and personally challenging, visit to London, our overall experience was extremely positive, and we honestly felt like we were in a home away from home and it is all credit to this awesome team of people.  The Royal Lancaster is now our favorite London hotel, we will definitely be back and look forward to connecting again with our new friends.",

Great shower and toiletries. A desk and a lounge sofa made this a very pleasant stay ( 3 nights) ..  Everything you would want or need.. \nA very inviting coffee lounge ,2  restaurants and a terrific bar... Breakfast was Continental or cooked with loads of choice. Very attentive staff and great doorman to help you with your luggage or get you a Taxi.. \nHope to stay there again one day…..",

Everyone on the team supported me with our requirements and special thanks to Ernestas for your patience. We were greeted at the train station by Jimmy who drove us around London and treated us like royalty. We did not know what to expect and Jimmy was a real highlight of the weekend, I would recommend this service to anyone who has concerns about transportation in the city.\n\nWe stayed in the Two Bedroomed Park Suite which was absolutely wonderful and we had everything we could possibly need.\n\nBreakfast was excellent, such a lovely restaurant, great choice of food with great views of Hyde Park.\n\nEach and every member of staff is a pleasure to deal with, they cannot do enough for you, they really are a credit to the hotel.\n\nWe can't recommend the Royal Lancaster enough, it is an amazing hotel, it ticks all the boxes for excellence.\n\nThank you all for a wonderful stay!",

Unless you are walking around dripping in Harrods bags you seem to be ignored. Breakfast is really good, but we shouldn’t have to ask for toast 3 times, coffee twice or listen to staff arguments whilst dining. On Sunday morning there were a few grumpy people working in the bar outside the main breakfast room who should have taken the day off. When we asked where our water was, for the 3rd time, she barked at us saying it would be 5 minutes. We’d already been sitting for 10 minutes listening to her moaning loudly about another member of staff rather than do her job. Not worth the money, sadly.",

    "text": "Further to my recent stay at your hotel 13th to 14th November 2024, I must record that this was NOT my best experience with you at the Royal Lancaster London.\n\nNot in the habit of complaining yet on this occasion, I need to bring some observations to your attention.\n\nCheck in 13th November 2024, the room allocated was 1210, the room in itself is nice with great views over London, especially at night. I was later than expected arriving / checking in at your hotel, due to work commitments, therefore was chasing my tail to get ready for our SoPHE annual charity dinner, which was held in your Westbourne Suite. Once in the room I was desperate for a Tea or a Coffee only to find No Standard Filter or Decaffeinated Coffee bags also no English Breakfast Tea bags in the drawers. I telephoned from the room and was put through to housekeeping, who firstly asked if I had checked the drawers and then they promised to deliver some coffee / tea bags to the room, these did Not arrive by the time I left the room some 45Mins after making the call. On returning to my room circa 01.15hrs on the 14th November 2024, there was still No sign of Coffee or Tea bags in the room or No biscuits therefore I had to make further calls to housekeeping to request again.\n\nMy nights sleep in room 1210, was somewhat disturbed due to noise with the hotel plumbing / soil stack systems which are pulling under vacuum when toilets are flushed on lower floors and where the Soil Vent Pipes SVP’s are trying to vent and the connecting sanitary traps are gurgling and trying to equalise out. The A/C system in the room was also noisy with changeover valves at FCU’s chattering. Due to lack of sleep I ordered breakfast in my room where I understood carried a £4.00 tray service, which I was willing to pay, yet when checking out the Hotel I was then further advised by Tyana that there was circa a further £20.00+ service charge to pay!!!! I questioned what additional payment was for, where it was explained this was for the staff???? The Additional £20.00+ I did not agree to pay, yet believe I am still being charged the £4.00 tray service which I had originally agreed too.\n\nAll in all this year was Not the best experience at the Royal Lancaster London, I had promised your receptionist Tyana that I would write and explain improvements that need to be made, where I now await your response to the above to close out these issues.\n\nKind Regards\n\nDR.

From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel really special.\n\nOur room was  lovely with incredible views over London and Hyde Park, there were even thoughtful gifts waiting for us, which was such a nice touch. Throughout our stay, everyone we met was so polite, friendly, and professional. A lot of the team even wished us a happy birthday, which made the experience feel really personal.\n\nAs parents, this was a rare child-free getaway, and it turned out to be one of the most relaxing and enjoyable breaks we’ve had in ages. The attention to detail the hotel has and the effort from the team didn’t go unnoticed—we felt so well looked after.\n\nThank you to everyone at the Royal Lancaster for making our weekend so memorable. We’re already looking forward to our next stay!",

    "text": "Our family of three recently enjoyed yet another stay at the Royal Lancaster London, marking my visit to this exceptional hotel. And once again, it exceeded all our expectations, solidifying its place as my favorite London retreat.\n\nThe breakfast buffet is nothing short of legendary. A feast for the senses, it offers a dazzling array of fresh fruits, baked goods, hearty English classics, and global delights.\n\nDinner at the Nipa Thai restaurant was an exquisite culinary journey. The dishes were a masterclass in flavor, with every bite showcasing the chefs’ dedication to authenticity and quality. The rich, aromatic Massaman curry was a highlight, and the attentive service made the evening even more special.\n\nFrom the warm welcome at check-in to the friendly concierge who helped us plan our family outings, every staff member treated us like cherished guests. Their genuine hospitality made us feel completely at home.\n\nAs a family, we value comfort and convenience, and the Royal Lancaster delivers both in spades. The beautifully appointed rooms, central location overlooking Hyde Park, and thoughtful amenities are just the icing on the cake.\n\nThis hotel has become a cherished part of our London tradition, and we can’t wait to return for a fourth stay.",

This hotel is a great location to stay in whether on business or pleasure with great views overlooking Hyde park and a short walk from Paddington station. It also has great transport links on the Central Line towards Oxford Street & White City in Shepherds Bush for some serious shopping. I would recommend the Royal Lancaster as a great place to stay when in London. !!",

And, the bartenders went above and beyond to ensure that we felt welcome.  Daniel was engaging and provided outstanding service;  Maya greeted us with a smile and made the most beautiful drinks!  I can't thank them enough for contributing to a very enjoyable stay.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was a good start to the day and had a large array of choices.

The stunning set up in the hotel foyer for Christmas was beautiful we had lots of pictures there . We were then greeted by Emma who was so kind , warming and made us feel so at home and welcomed . We had been upgraded by them out of kindness for our stay which was also fantastic . In the room we had cookies and cake waiting for us , A play tent for my little boy , colouring books, toys and a Paddington bear teddy which my little boy was over the moon with . They even had a warm dog bed and treats waiting for the puppy . Our stay was lovely the beds were amazing , the best night sleep we have ever had and the breakfast in the morning brought to our room was mouthwatering . We polished it all off . Emma ever greeted us at the end of our stay to make sure everything was perfect which indeed it was . I have recommended this place to all my family and friends and will definitely be returning in the future . We all had the best time and made the most amazing memories . Merry Christmas and Happy New year to all the lovely staff at Royal Lancaster London ❤️",

It was a family trip with 2 adults and our 5-year-old daughter. \n\nThe Royal Lancaster has been on the list for a very long time, and this year, we decided to stay—and what a good decision it was! \n\nThere is a reason this hotel is so highly rated and I will try to do it justice in my review. \nBefore we reseved I had signed up for free to the friends benefits on the website and booked directly, this gives you some benefits such as complimentary breakfast, early check-in and check-out, room upgrades where available, 10% off restaurants and bars, 50% off the car park and up to 20% off best flexible rates. This is so worth doing. \n\n2 days before our visit we were phoned by Emma part of the customer relations team, she asked us about our trip and what we were doing. I had told her that we were visiting Winter Wonderland and the Paddington Bear experience the next day, I said we were traveling with our 5-year-old daughter and anything they could do to make this trip truly special would mean the world, and they did! \n\nWe arrived early on Saturday morning, around 11:40, our room was available, and we were upgraded from a triple room, which looked amazing, to an executive room. We were told this had amazing views, and boy were they right! At the reception desk we were told that Emma would like to see us, she came out with a Paddington Bear teddy for my daughter, along with a frisbee, crayons, and a booklet to fill in. We were blown away by this gesture and it really set the Royal Lancaster apart from anywhere we have stayed. \n\nWe were taken to our room on the 17th floor and helped with our bags, upon entry the view of central London and Hyde Park took our breath away, it was truly amazing! The room was clean, and spacious and had all you needed. There was a lovely desk area to work if you needed to. Each side of the bed had plugs and USBs, which I find important. A steam iron, again a necessity, and Jo loves products in the bathroom, this room also included a bath and a shower, lovely touch. \n\nWe headed out for the day where we would return to the hotel later on in the evening. \nWhen we got back to the room the hotel had left lots of fresh cakes and notes, written to us and our daughter, again incredible gesture. That evening we didn't watch the TV, we just sat looking out the window. \n\nWe had a wonderful night's sleep in the comfiest bed, I have to say the room was so quiet as well. \nOur check out was 12:00, we made full advantage of this. We headed down for our breakfast, which was lovely, so much choice in a buffet style. There was an al a carte option, we weren't offered this so I can't comment on it, or even if we should have had it, however, there was more than enough choice on offer, and all were extremely high quality. Breakfast was served in the park restaurant, with lovely views over Hyde Park. \n\nWe headed back to the room, got our things, and checked out putting our bags in the storage area. It was raining when we left so we asked for an umbrella, which we were offered 2 and told we could keep them, again unreal service. \n\nWe have tried many Hotels in London, and all have been wonderful, but this one just hit differently. We will 100% be returning next year to the Royal Lancaster and will really look forward to it. \nThank you to all the team.",

From the moment we arrive until we leave, the whole team here make a special effort to make you feel welcome and make your stay very enjoyable.\nCheck in is very smooth. \nOn this trip, we made it all the way to floor 18, which is quite another level. The executive room is finished to a very high standard with fantastic views across Hyde Park to the City.\nThe bathroom is excellent with both a bath and walk in shower. \nBed very comfortable with nice linen and a turn down service. A nice little touch with seasonal treats on arrival!\nWhat makes a big difference here is the staff engagement. It takes some effort to get all the team on point all the time, especially when the hotel is busy with overnight guests but also Christmas parties. But nobody skips a beat and service is always with a smile!",

Welcomed every day by the staff and porters lifting their hat. Every interaction was thoughtful, and no detail was overlooked. These small things matter to us.  The room was spacious and filled with extra amenities by Guest Services. They even left a message on the phone, so thoughtful.\nBreakfast staff were every morning very friendly, the breakfast was an extensive variety and was really delicious. \n\nSpecial thanks to the concierge Dan for helping us with the restaurants and tickets to the Theatre.\n\nWe cannot recommend it highly enough and will definitely return in the future.",

Although the room was a little on the small side for the price, I can honestly say it was an excellent stay. The room was well appointed with plug sockets, mirrors, iron and ironing board etc. The bed was sooooo comfortable, I slept like a baby! The bathroom had great toiletries and the AC worked well (I have stayed in so many hotels where the AC is just rubbish!). I'm a creature of habit, so when I'm in London I normally stay in the same two or three hotels and have never considered the Royal Lancaster... but I will from now on. Would definitely recommend!",

The warmth and professionalism of all the staff ensure we will be returning and, indeed, we are already making plans for our next visit.\nOne amenity is the breakfast buffet that is far superior to any others we've experienced.  They also have an ala carte menu for such cooked items as poached eggs Florentine and even shakshuka.  That, combined with the views of Hyde Park, would be enough of a recommendation but what makes it outstanding is the brilliant and attentive staff who always make us feel very welcome to include everyone throughout the Royal Lancaster.\nWe are so looking forward to seeing all of them again.",

Tube stop at the back of the hotel for central line… perfect to get to the shops then you have Paddington station close by. The bed was perfect! The room 427 was amazing! Well worth the money! And hopefully now we will take this room every-time! \n\nWe had a lovely check in woman, her name was Eden! She was so kind and friendly. Perfect first impression! Then the bar staff and door staff were extremely friendly! Nothing is too much.\n\nWe had a lovely room server called Alistair which he was so amazing and friendly! True credit to the hotel! Knew his stuff and was very friendly! \n\nThe 2 people that I have mentioned please make sure you keep them! They’re a credit to your hotel! \n\nThank you so much for the lovely weekend! We will be back! And next with our fur baby! \nNow we know it’s dog friendly and they have services to accommodate that.\n\nSee you 2025 :)",

I really wanted to book a room overlooking Hyde Park and Winter Wonderland and she was very efficient in answering all my questions. I felt confident I had made the right choice after looking at all the hotels available around Hyde Park.\nWe arrived on one of the many stormy weekends mid morning on a Saturday and were greeted by the lovely Tyana. Arriving way before check in we were surprised to be able to check in early. It was absolutely the right hotel to choose for a special celebration. My Husband was wished Happy Birthday by Tyana when we checked in. The room was perfect room number 1224 which had an incredible city view and view of Winter Wonderland. Balloons were in the room and when we returned from our day at Winter Wonderland there was a cake and a card. \nWe had a delicious meal in the Nipa Thai. \nAble to arrange a late checkout with Tyana we could spend the morning shopping and when we left were gifted little boxes of chocolates each.\nWith the high winds the staff members at the door were working incredibly hard to keep the entrance clear of leaves, however always stopped to greet you and talk. Everyone was so friendly and took great care in their roles. On the Sunday morning the hotel was decorated for Christmas, a magical finish to a memorable stay.",

Very comfortable room, great bed and no noise at night. Our first hotel experience with our 3 month old baby and the staff could not have been kinder or more helpful to us and our baby girl. Nertila even went to the length of washing our baby bottles every morning for us - this made our lives so much easier and I can’t thank her enough. Excellent food at breakfast and from the in room dining (Club sandwich was the best I’ve had anywhere). Miriam at breakfast was full of joy every morning and clearly genuinely loves the work does. Literally can’t think of a negative so I’ll leave it there! Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to make our stay so special.",

    "text": "I recently stayed at the Royal Lancaster in London for the first time with my family. I booked a family connecting room, which offered good value at the price point. As previous posts have mentioned, these family rooms are extremely small; however, they are perfect for a short stay in London.\n\nThe hotel and the rooms are exceptionally clean. There are some issues with the flushing systems in the bathrooms that need to be resolved, as it’s not easy to flush every time. Something minor that i hope the hotel looks at. \n\nThe breakfast at this hotel is exceptional—one of the best I have experienced. There is a wide spread, and the quality is excellent. The staff at breakfast go out of their way to assist you. There are six lifts in the hotel, and you never have to wait more than a minute for one to arrive.\n\nThe location of the hotel is close to Hyde Park and Paddington Station, and the Lancaster Gate tube station is just around the corner. It’s a very convenient location for exploring London.\n\nThe biggest asset of this hotel is the staff. I have never experienced such pleasant, helpful, and warm employees at any hotel I have stayed at. Every staff member at the Royal Lancaster goes out of their way to ensure that their guests are happy at all times. I have stayed in many hotels in London throughout the years, but the staff at the Royal Lancaster were exceptional.\n\nI have definitely found my new favorite hotel in London and look forward to visiting again.",

The Lobby and Front desk team were very welcoming and friendly and also greeted with smile, the doorman Vlad took care of our luggage's and our personal belongings, one of the concierge staff member even took our luggage's straight to our room. We were greeted by Emma and Mak at the Front desk which help us through the process of checking in. The room that  we were given was beyond our expectation, my two boys cant stop admiring the view it's almost seeing an aerial view of the whole surrounding area. I encourage anyone to use this Hotel even if visiting the capital for either for a short or long term. Throughout our stay we never even hear any  noises from other Guest rooms, I suppose due to the newly refurbish Hotel they make sure Guest privacy is one of their number one priority. The Breakfast buffet at the Park Restaurant is something you can appreciate because there are so many variety of hot and cold foods, Ala carte menu is always offered but for us the Buffet is  more than enough to satisfy our cravings. We also would like to say thank you to the staff at Nipa Thai Restaurant, the authenticity of the ingredients uses is something to be admire, as a Thai person I know for a fact that no alternative veg and herbs were use in their dishes, it's like being at home.",

Every staff member I interacted with, especially Ricky from reception, was kind, helpful, and genuinely cared about making my experience special.\n\nI had booked my room the day before my birthday (though it wasn’t actually my birthday), and to my surprise, they upgraded my room and provided complimentary wine/sweets. The views from my room were absolutely stunning!\n\nThe service was exceptional, with personalised recommendations and quick assistance whenever needed. Breakfast at the restaurant was a highlight—an incredible mix of English and Asian cuisine that was both unique and delicious.\n\nThank you, Royal Lancaster London, for going above and beyond. I can’t wait to return!",

The reservations team had ensured that balloons and a beautiful miniature birthday cake together with a card were ready in our room when we arrived - so thoughtful. \nLater, we had dinner in the hotel’s Thai restaurant. The food was wonderful - really tasty, authentic and interesting with so much choice. Again, they had noted our daughter’s birthday and brought her a mini cake and sang to her - the other diners joined in which was lovely. \nThe executive hotel rooms are spacious, have excellent storage and are thoughtfully laid out. The beds are very comfortable and the showers are amazing. We would definitely stay at the Foyal Lancaster again. Thank you for a wonderfully memorable stay",

The attention what we get was absolutely amazing. The little details prepared from housekeeping for my mother’s birthday a little cake saying happy birthday, handwritten welcome card and as a welcome drink we had a bottle of champagne! Personalised pillowcases were prepared in the room and many details what make us really welcome and we got that emotional touch. We visited Lounge Bar at Royal Lancaster and the experience was unbelievably amazing thanks Mohamed and Mounir! \nFrom entering the hotel to checking out we felt so special from every member of the staff what we met in corridors or reception Lots and Devon and Adu and big thanks to Sebastian and Ryan and Jaimie for helping us. We had amazing room with Hyde park  view so we decided to order in room dining so while having a best dinner in town we enjoyed beautiful view . Definitely will come back and if you are thinking to spend special night than the Royal Lancaster hotel  is place what you are looking for. There is Doorman Amr  He is a wonderful person to talk to, kind, polite and professional , Amr's appearance fantastic, and another Doorman Fabri help us with our luggage he is so funny \nplease share this feedback with housekeeping team as they have to see how amazing job they do!",

The staff are professional and very attentive and the food is absolutely amazing. \nThe hotel is in a great location too, absolutely perfect for the sights and shows of London. The Royal Lancaster hotel is unbeatable.\nTo be fair we didn't actually stay at the royal Lancaster  on this occasion but did make full use of the facilities over a couple of days.\nWe popped in on our first evening \nA great welcome from Amr at the door, amazingly he remembered us from previous stays and was his usual professional and warm self. He had so much information about London. Helped me with getting a cab and telling them where I needed to go. I had a cold and Amr got the hotel to send to my room hot water, honey and lemons. So very appreciated. Helped with my cold",

The Hotel continues to be the most wonderfully calm and beautifully presented place to stay. Ideally situated across from Hyde Park ( for lovely walks) One can get from the hotel to the very centre of London - as We did - on the very frequent London Buses in  fifteen minutes or take the tube which is situated directly outside the hotel.\nOur room was immaculately prepared on arrival and throughout Our stay with Our room manager checking all was well with Our Accomodation during Our Stay.\nOn one day We did not require Our room to be made up and in response The Royal Lancaster planted a tree !\nWe enjoyed eating in at the Hotel and had Our Business Meetings in the Cafe with quiete efficient attendance for Drinks and Pastries as required.\nWe spent an afternoon in the main lounge also being more than well serviced and very much enjoyed Our early evening meal there.\nThe standout feature for Me was that there was always  plenty of cheerful staff to cover any service requirement that We needed at whatever time and We always felt We were made special although I feel sure that went for all the guests.\nThis is a genuine review - We have stayed at this hotel five times in previous years and next time We visit London ; without doubt; We will choose The Royal Lancaster again.",
